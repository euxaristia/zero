// The shared-root compensating deny (windows_acl.go) puts a direct,
// non-inheriting DenyWrite on each of C:\, %ProgramData%, %SystemRoot%\Temp,
// and C:\Users\Public. That blocks new writes directly under those objects, but
// a Windows access check for an EXISTING child never evaluates a non-inherited
// ACE on the child's parent, so a pre-existing descendant that independently
// grants BUILTIN\Users or Authenticated Users write stays writable once the
// elevated fully-restricted (DenyRead) token is broadened with those two groups,
// a write outside every configured write root. This file enumerates those
// existing writable descendants and denies each one directly.
//
// The scan is deliberately bounded and targeted, NOT a blanket recursive walk:
// stamping an inheritable deny (or rewriting every descendant's ACL) across the
// system drive is the exact slow/brittle/ACL-polluting pathology the
// inheritable-deny approach was rejected for. Instead the traversal only ever
// WRITES a deny to a descendant it has confirmed is already writable by those
// broad groups, and it prunes the enormous non-writable system trees
// (C:\Windows, C:\Program Files) so cost stays bounded:
//
//   - It always descends the first windowsDescendantScanBaselineDepth levels,
//     so a shallow, freshly installed writable directory is caught even when its
//     parent is not itself writable.
//   - Below the baseline it descends ONLY into a directory that is itself
//     writable by the broad groups. A writable subtree is the real escape
//     surface and is small in practice, while a non-writable directory cannot
//     have been reached by such a write and so is pruned.
//   - windowsDescendantScanMaxDepth and windowsDescendantScanMaxDirs are hard
//     safety caps against a pathological deep or very broad writable tree; if
//     either is hit the scan stops (leaving deeper writable descendants
//     unscanned, a bounded residual gap, still strictly smaller than the
//     root-object-only enforcement it replaces).
//
// Reparse points (junctions/symlinks) are skipped entirely: their target lives
// outside this subtree, so denying or descending them would touch unrelated
// objects and risk traversal loops.
